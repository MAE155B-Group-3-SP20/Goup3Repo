The final goal is to reach the final Drag value
That is the thrust we will need to keep the aircraft at a steady flying state.
To get drag, we need to get the final CD

To get to coeffecient of Drag: CD we need the following:
Already optimization given inputs:

alpha
AR
mach number (need a velocity translation component which can be found from turbofan)
cos sweep (sweep)
S_ref (prob just S but unsure)


Constants: 
Re (reynold's num)



CUrrent misisng inputs:

CDo
CLa
CLo
Width
Length
t/c
chord length

We need components that could calculate the above missing inputs perferably from the optimization given inputs. 

Values that are calculated in the proccess:
CDi
CDv
CDw
CL - note important
CD - as a final product

To produce drag we need 
sec_forces (unsure what it is)

~~alpha (angle of attack)~~ satisfied
~~ beta ~~ satisfied as it is likely sweep
